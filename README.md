# Æsir

Æsir — an open-source cross-platform MMORPG client.

## Building
* Go to https://cloud.acomirei.ru/s/6Y0T4jvdkvYEIRc and grab data.7z and deps.7z.
* Extract data.7z to bin directory.
* Extract deps to utils directory.

For building you should have VC++ 2017, D compiler and Sublime Text.

You can grab D compiler(prefixed with dmd) from the bottom of d.acomirei.ru, but it requires some tweaks to work.

Those compilers are configured to use local copy of VC++, so I think you can just replace sc.ini(settings file) with one from official dmd distribution from dlang.org or modify it by yourself.

Open the project from sublime text and run building of dependencies: packet gen, shader gen, opengl gen.

Then build the Æsir itself using first dub command.
